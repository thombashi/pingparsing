                       destination_or_file [destination_or_file ...]

    positional arguments:
      destination_or_file   Destinations to send ping or files to parse. '-' for
                            parsing the standard input.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --max-workers MAX_WORKERS
                            Number of threads for when multiple destinations/files
                            are specified. Defaults to equal two times the number
                            of cores.
      --debug               for debug print.
      --quiet               suppress execution log messages.

    Ping Options:
      --timestamp {none,epoch,datetime}
                            [Only for LINUX] none: no timestamps. epoch: add
                            timestamps with UNIX epoch time format. datetime: add
                            timestamps with ISO time format.
      -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                            Stop after sending the count. see also ping(8) [-c
                            count] option description.
      -s PACKET_SIZE, --packet-size PACKET_SIZE
                            Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.
      --ttl TTL             Specifies the Time to Live.
      -w DEADLINE, --deadline DEADLINE
                            Timeout before ping exits. valid time units are:
                            d/day/days, h/hour/hours, m/min/mins/minute/minutes,
                            s/sec/secs/second/seconds,
                            ms/msec/msecs/millisecond/milliseconds,
                            us/usec/usecs/microsecond/microseconds. if no unit
                            string found, considered seconds as the time unit. see
                            also ping(8) [-w deadline] option description. note:
                            meaning of the 'deadline' may differ system from to
                            system.
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Time to wait for a response per packet. Valid time
                            units are: d/day/days, h/hour/hours,
                            m/min/mins/minute/minutes, s/sec/secs/second/seconds,
                            ms/msec/msecs/millisecond/milliseconds,
                            us/usec/usecs/microsecond/microseconds. If no unit
                            string is found, consider milliseconds as the time
                            unit. Attempt to send packets with milliseconds
                            granularity in default. If the system does not support
                            timeout in milliseconds, round up as seconds. Use
                            system default if not specified. This option will be
                            ignored if the system does not support timeout itself.
                            See also ping(8) [-W timeout] option description.
                            note: meaning of the 'timeout' may differ from system
                            to system.
      -I INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                            network interface
      --addopts OPTIONS     extra command line options

    Output Options:
      --indent INDENT       JSON output will be pretty-printed with the indent
                            level. (default= 4)
      --icmp-reply, --icmp-replies
                            print results for each ICMP packet reply.
      --timezone TIMEZONE   Time zone for timestamps.
      --no-color            Turn off colors.
