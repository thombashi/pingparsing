    Ping Options:
      -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                            stop after sending the count. see also ping(8) [-c
                            count] option description.
      -w DEADLINE, --deadline DEADLINE
                            timeout in seconds. see also ping(8) [-w deadline]
                            option description. note: meaning of the 'deadline'
                            may differ system to system.
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Time to wait for a response, in milliseconds. If the
                            system does not support timeout in milliseconds, round
                            up as seconds. Use system default if not specified.
                            Ignored if the system does not support timeout itself.
                            See also ping(8) [-W timeout] option description.
                            note: meaning of the 'timeout' may differ system to
                            system.
      -I INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                            network interface
